## Object Detection using YOLO

</div>

##Description 
In this project, We have implemented an object detection system using YOLO. To begin with, Initially, we first collected small data(i.e. 100) and label each image using labelimg. The labelimg software can be found at "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MfarNCecS7OirCdeAVXCmO6_uPkgerQY?usp=sharing". Using this software, label each images. 

Now for training, use YoloV3_Trainning notebook file. After completion of training, use the wieghts and run the python files test_on_photo.py of object detection in image and test_on_video.py for detection on live video. Similarly, we can detect object in all the dataset that we collected by using the Test_working_batch_photos.py file.

To download weights, goto:

Use this for testing purpose only.

Note: You can even implement other same project which is store in folder yolo_model and weights related to this project can be found in following link:
